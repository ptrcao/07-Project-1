# Fuel Seeker NSW

<p style="background-color:yellow;font-weight:bold;">IMPORTANT: this project uses a CORS workaround.  You may need to go to https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo and click to request temporary access to the CORS proxy server that we use, in order to be able to view the website properly.  Note that this is purely a development constraint, and a limitation of not being allowed a backend in this project.  In a real-world production app, this CORS complication would not be applicable because the APIs calls would be handled unproblematically at the back end.  If there are any issues, please contact the authors.</p>

## Description

Fuel Seeker is an application that allows users to search for fuel nearby to their location. Users can search by Fuel Type and Radius (km), with ranking on either Price or Distance.
The projct uses two Third Party API's.
 - NSW Fuel API - a governement API which is used to get the nearby fuel prices across NSW.
 - Google Maps Javascript API - used to display both interactive and static maps that show the location of fuel stations and directions from the user's location. 

 This app was developed as finding cheap and accessible fuel is important to a lot of people and the existing web app alternatives presented consumers with information overload and analysis paralysis.  This app narrows down the relevant picks for motorists, and ranks them for their convenience and ease of decision-making.
